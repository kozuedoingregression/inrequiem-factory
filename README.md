# InRequiem's Smartphone-Based Telemetry App

## Overview
**InRequiem** is a prototype web application that transforms a smartphone into a telemetry device for motorsports and racing enthusiasts. By leveraging built-in smartphone sensors, e-Track eliminates the need for expensive telemetry hardware while providing essential real-time data for performance analysis.

## Features
- **Dashboard**: A central hub displaying key telemetry metrics.
- **Speedometer**: Real-time speed tracking using GPS.
- **Lap & Sector Timing**: Measures lap times and sector performance.
- **0-100 km/h Time**: Calculates acceleration performance.
- **Leaderboard**: Ranks drivers based on their telemetry data.
- **Crew System**: Allows users to form teams and compete collectively.
- **Data Logging**: Captures and stores driving sessions for analysis.

## How It Works
1. **Setup**: Open the web app on your smartphone.
2. **Start a Session**: Activate the telemetry mode to start recording speed and movement data.
3. **View Live Metrics**: Monitor real-time speed, acceleration, and lap times on the dashboard.
4. **Analyze Performance**: Access historical data and compare results.
5. **Compete**: Join leaderboards and crew rankings to challenge other drivers.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: Next.js
- **Backend**: Node.js (Planned future enhancements)
- **APIs**: Utilizes Web APIs for GPS and motion sensor data
- **Storage**: Local storage and potential cloud integration for data persistence

## Future Enhancements
- **Cloud-Based Data Storage**
- **AI-Powered Driving Insights**
- **Support for More Sensors (e.g., Gyroscope, Accelerometer)**
- **Advanced Visualizations & Data Export**

## Getting Started
To try the prototype:
1. Open the web app in your mobile browser.
2. Allow necessary permissions for location and motion data.
3. Start a telemetry session and track your driving performance!
